# 🧾 Invoice Generation Fix for One-Time Services

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

You weren't seeing invoices for additional services (like the €5K Product Audit) because **one-time payments** in Stripe don't automatically generate invoices that appear in the customer portal.

### **Before Fix:**
- ✅ **Subscriptions** (€2K, €10K, €15K monthly) → Auto-generate invoices ✅
- ❌ **One-time payments** (€5K audit, €1.5K board advisory) → No invoices ❌

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Added Invoice Creation for One-Time Payments**

Updated `/src/app/api/stripe/create-checkout-session/route.ts` to include:

```typescript
// For one-time payments, ensure invoice is created and appears in customer portal
...(mode === 'payment' && {
  invoice_creation: {
    enabled: true,
    invoice_data: {
      description: `ConnEthics ${serviceName}`,
      metadata: {
        service_name: serviceName,
        service_type: 'one_time',
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### **What This Does:**
1. **Forces Stripe to create an invoice** for one-time payments
2. **Invoice appears in customer portal** alongside subscription invoices
3. **Proper payment history** is maintained
4. **PDF invoices** are generated automatically
5. **Metadata tracking** for service type and name

---

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test One-Time Service Purchase:**

1. **Go to consulting services page**: `/consulting-services`
2. **Click "Product & Business Audit"** (€5K one-time service)
3. **Complete the checkout process**
4. **Check customer portal** → Should now see the invoice!

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ **Payment processed** successfully
- ✅ **Invoice generated** with proper description
- ✅ **Invoice appears** in customer portal
- ✅ **Payment history** shows the transaction
- ✅ **PDF download** available for the invoice

## 🎯 **Service Types & Invoicing**

- ✅ **Transitional Manager** (€15K/month) → Monthly invoices

## 🔧 **Additional Improvements Made**

  additional_service_key: additionalServiceKey,
}
```

### **Customer Portal Visibility:**
