# LinkedIn Post Proposal: Arazzo Launch

**Context:** Launch of the Arazzo Insight page + Playground + VS Code Extension.
**Target Audience:** CTOs, API Product Managers, Lead Developers, Innovation Directors.
**Tone:** The Pragmatic Visionary (Authoritative, Business-First, Empowering).

## Strategy: "The Orchestration Gap"

**Core Message:** We have mastered *defining* APIs (OpenAPI), but we are failing at *orchestrating* them. Arazzo is the solution, and ConnEthics provides the tools to use it today.

**Storytelling Arc:**
1.  **The Status Quo:** We treat APIs as static endpoints.
2.  **The Friction:** Business value requires sequences (workflows), not just endpoints. This "glue" is currently hidden in PDFs or Slack messages.
3.  **The Shift:** Arazzo turns "documentation" into "executable specifications".
4.  **The Proof:** We built the open-source tools to make this reality accessible now.

## Draft Post

**Headline:** Stop documenting Endpoints. Start designing Workflows.

In the API economy, we have obsessed over the "dots" (Endpoints/OpenAPI) but ignored the "lines" that connect them (Workflows).

The result? Integration hell.
Developers are left guessing the sequence of calls needed to "Onboard a User" or "Issue a Credential". The business logic is buried in PDF guides or tribal knowledge.

**This ends with Arazzo.**

Arazzo is the new specification under the OpenAPI Initiative that defines **sequences of calls**, inputs, and success criteria. It bridges the gap between technical capability and business intent.

At ConnEthics, we don't just watch standards emerge; we build the ecosystem to make them usable.

Today, we are releasing a comprehensive guide on Arazzo, along with **two open-source tools** to accelerate your adoption:

1.  **The Arazzo Visualizer:** Instantly turn YAML into interactive flowcharts.
2.  **The VS Code Extension:** Design, validate, and document workflows directly in your IDE.

Strategic Intelligence isn't just about having data. It's about mastering the *flow* of data.

## Visual Assets Recommendation

*   **Carousel (PDF):**
    *   Slide 1: "The Missing Link in API Orchestration" (Big bold text)
    *   Slide 2: Problem: "Swagger defines the What. Who defines the How?"
    *   Slide 3: Solution: "Enter Arazzo. The OpenAPI for Workflows."
    *   Slide 4: Screenshot of the **Visualizer** (The "Builder" view).
    *   Slide 5: Screenshot of the **VS Code Extension** (Split screen code/preview).
    *   Slide 6: "Read the Guide & Try the Tools. Link in comments."

*   **Alternative (Video):** A 30-second screen recording showing:
    1.  Typing a step in VS Code.
    2.  Seeing the arrow appear in the Flowchart instantly.
    3.  Switching to the Web Visualizer to show the "Business View".
